# Sometimes-I-Wonder
Sometimes I wonder, what makes me so depressed.
Sometimes I wonder, why is my life so messed.
Sometimes I wonder, why does this happen only with me,
Sometimes I wonder, when all of this will be over and I will be set free.

Emptiness has become a part of me,
My life stands still like a motionless tree.
Getting abandoned by my friends has become my biggest fear,
When I look around, I find no one to wipe my tears.

I did not even realise since when my smile turned into frown,
Although I am smiling but I feel as if I have drowned.

Sometimes I wonder, have I committed any sin,
SometimesI wonder, am I worth being treated as a bin.
Sometimes I wonder, why do I feel so alone in a crowd,
Sometimes I wonder, should I store everything in my heart or shout in loud.

Do I really deserve this solitude?
Do I really have a problem of attitude?
Do I really belong to the dark?
Have I really lost my optimistic spark?

Right now a genuine hug is all that I need,
I think I have punished enough for all my previous deeds.

Sometimes I wonder, will I be ever happy again or will my life keep buffering,
Sometimes I wonder....Oh well now I have even stopped wondering.
